            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>We are a group of Environment Student enrolled in the course ENVR 401. In our group project for this course, we are working for MOOS to develop a detailed tree inventory protocol they can follow to redo the campus tree inventory. We are also studying the suitable tree species to plant on campus to provide MOOS with a comprehensive decision tree for future planting to increase biodiversity and resilience.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="inventory">
            <h1>Tree Inventory Helper</h1>
            <p>This app is a part of the inventory protocol, and will be used during tree inventory. Chrome is the ideal browser for this app. Users should use cellular data while using this app. This will allow the app to run faster and provide quick response.</p>
            <p>User guide</p>
            <ul>
                <li>During inventory, if the user gets to a hard-to-identify tree, they can first locate themselves on the map by clicking the “target” button on the top right of the map, and try to find the hard-to-identify tree on the map. The trees are displayed as green points on the map. </li>
                <li>If the user successfully locates it, click on the point and the species name will pop up. </li>
                <li>If the species provided doesn't make sense, or the user cannot identify the tree on the map, click the “get my location” button near the top of the app, and the tree species within 10 meters will show up. </li>
                <li>From the species list, determine which species the hard-to-identify tree could be. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="decision">
            <h1>Planting Decision Tree</h1>
            <p>This is the decision tree that allows user to input their requriements, such as function priority and location, and provides a list of tree species to plant. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="key">
            <h1>Dichotomous Key Tool</h1>
            <p>This app is also part of the tree inventory protocol, and will be used during the tree inventory. Chrome is the ideal browser for this app. While this app can be used for other McGill properties, it is not a full dichotomous key and is catered specifically to potential tree species on McGill’s downtown campus as well as other tree species that are commonly planted in urban environments.</p>
            <p>User guide</p>
            <ul>
                <li>During the inventory if the user gets to a hard-to-identify tree, they can use this app to both verify the tree species listed in the Tree Inventory Helper, as well as identify trees that may be new or unlisted in the Helper.</li>
                <li>The user needs to enter the website, read the options available, and choose the option that seems the most accurate to the tree in front of them.</li>
                <li>The photos listed are the most identifiable traits pertaining to each question.</li>
                <li>Keep selecting the options that feel the most accurate to first identify the genus of the tree. You can then continue the quiz to identify the species of the tree.</li>
                <li>You can always use the back button if the results feel innacurate!</li>
            </ul>
